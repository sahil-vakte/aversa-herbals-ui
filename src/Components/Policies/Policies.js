                  At AHPL, we respect every individual's right to privacy. Our
                  relationship with you is our most valuable asset and is the
                  very basis of our name and reputation. We understand the
                  importance you place on the privacy and security of
                  information that personally identifies you or your account
                  information. We refer to and treat this information as
                  "personal information".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We do reserve the right to disclose or report personal
                  information in limited circumstances where we believe in good
                  faith that disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with
                  regulators or law enforcement authorities, or to protect our
                  rights or property.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We use personal information in ways that are compatible with
                  the purposes for which we originally requested it. For
                  example, we will use the information you give us to process
                  your requests and transactions, to provide you with additional
                  information about products and services, or to evaluate your
                  financial needs. To do so, we may share personal information
                  with an independent distributor.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We limit the collection and use of personal information to
                  what is necessary to administer our business and to deliver
                  superior service to you. This may include advising you about
                  our products or services, those of our affiliates, and other
                  opportunities that we believe may interest you. To serve you
                  better, we may combine information you give us on the Web or
                  through other channels.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When we share personal information with an agent or affiliate,
                  we protect that personal information with a strict
                  confidentiality agreement. Companies that we hire to provide
                  support services or act as our agent must conform to our
                  privacy standards.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  AHPL corporate policies require that employees with access to
                  confidential customer information may not use or disclose the
                  information except for business use. All employees are
                  required to safeguard such information, as specified in their
                  confidentiality agreements with AHPL.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  On occasions we may assist a company that is not affiliated
                  with AHPL in providing or offering a product or service to
                  you. In such circumstances, marketing materials will include
                  instructions on how you can request not to receive those
                  communications in the future. In all cases your personal
                  information is protected by a strict confidentiality
                  agreement. We do not allow any non-affiliated company to
                  retain your personal information longer than necessary to
                  provide the product, service, or information, unless you
                  affirmatively grant us permission to do so.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We continue to evaluate our efforts to protect personal
                  information and make every effort to keep your personal
                  information accurate and up to date.
                  <br />

                  If you identify any error in your personal information or need
                  to make a change to that information, please contact us and we

                  cost of the product being returned, less total bonus paid out
                  by the Company on the original purchase and less 10% service
                  charge. The Buy Back policy is designed to impose upon the
                  sponsor and the Company the obligation to ensure that the
                  distributor is buying products wisely. Distributors are
                  requested to buy products that they can reasonably sell within
                  30 days period.
