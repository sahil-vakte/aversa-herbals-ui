            <p>
              At AHPL, we respect every individual's right to privacy. Our
              relationship with you is our most valuable asset and is the very
              basis of our name and reputation. We understand the importance you
              place on the privacy and security of information that personally
              identifies you or your account information. We refer to and treat
              this information as "personal information".
              <br />
              <br />
              We do reserve the right to disclose or report personal information
              in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that
              disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with regulators or
              law enforcement authorities, or to protect our rights or property.
              <br />
              <br />
              We use personal information in ways that are compatible with the
              purposes for which we originally requested it. For example, we
              will use the information you give us to process your requests and
              transactions, to provide you with additional information about
              products and services, or to evaluate your financial needs. To do
              so, we may share personal information with an independent
              distributor.
              <br />
              <br />
              We limit the collection and use of personal information to what is
              necessary to administer our business and to deliver superior
              service to you. This may include advising you about our products
              or services, those of our affiliates, and other opportunities that
              we believe may interest you. To serve you better, we may combine
              information you give us on the Web or through other channels.
              <br />
              <br />
              When we share personal information with an agent or affiliate, we
              protect that personal information with a strict confidentiality
              agreement. Companies that we hire to provide support services or
              act as our agent must conform to our privacy standards.
              <br />
              <br />
              AHPL corporate policies require that employees with access to
              confidential customer information may not use or disclose the
              information except for business use. All employees are required to
              safeguard such information, as specified in their confidentiality
              agreements with AHPL.
              <br />
              <br />
              On occasions we may assist a company that is not affiliated with
              AHPL in providing or offering a product or service to you. In such
              circumstances, marketing materials will include instructions on
              how you can request not to receive those communications in the
              future. In all cases your personal information is protected by a
              strict confidentiality agreement. We do not allow any
              non-affiliated company to retain your personal information longer
              than necessary to provide the product, service, or information,
              unless you affirmatively grant us permission to do so.
              <br />
              <br />
              We continue to evaluate our efforts to protect personal
              information and make every effort to keep your personal
              information accurate and up to date.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you identify any error in your personal information or need to
              make a change to that information, please contact us and we will
              promptly update our records.
              <br />
